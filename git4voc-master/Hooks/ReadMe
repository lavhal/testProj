In order to use Git4Voc, following steps must be performed:

1. Hooks folder should be copied to your repository.

2. Script InstallHooksAndTools should be executed (this will copy predefined hooks to .git/hooks folder and install tools: (1) Rapper and (2) Parrot).

After successful installation, pre-commit hook will be executed on each commit to perform syntax validation using Rapper and scanning for pitfalls using OOPS web service.

Post-commit hooks will generate documentation for modified files using Parrot.
